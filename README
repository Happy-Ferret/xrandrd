WIP: this is still not finished.
proof of concept can be found in "configure_displays.sh"

Usage: xrandrd

xrandrd will wait until a display get (dis-)connected and do the following:

1) disable all disconnected outputs.
2) find common mode if more than one display is connected.
3) enable all connected outputs using common mode or their preferred mode if no common mode could be found.

this behaviour is perfect to prepare your notebook for presentations on a projector.
no frustrating attemps to play with broken display configurators, just plug in and start talking.
unplugging should configure your notebook back to its best standalone settings and off you go.
